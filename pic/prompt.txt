create gpasm code for pic 12f629 code implementing device on/off cycle counter. The device should read last total on/off cycle count upon each reset (power on) , increment it and store it back into eeprom. uint32 should be used for the counter. Then the device should emit current cycle count using serial output and loop forever . Use wear levelling to reduce eeprom wear by reading all numbers in the eeprom , determining which one is the highest and writing back incremented number in a next address, or first address if it was last address. Use macros for 32bit arithmetic operations used to make code easily readable and compact.
